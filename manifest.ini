Version 1.3, released on 03/08/2020:
* The timezone selector dialog now has a filter box. NVDA will announce the number of results as the user starts typing into the filter field.

Version 1.2, released on 03/08/2020
* Python 2 support

Version 1.1, released on 03/08/2020
* The date and time is now announced in a separate thread to prevent hanging the NVDA thread in case retrieval takes a little while.
* The timezone selector dialog now has a cancel button and no longer prevents NVDA from shutting down.

Version 1.0, released on 03/07/2020
* Initial release, still experimental.
